This is my final project for Udacity's Android Nanodegree program. See below for screenshots. The app has three screens, a combined map and list screen to view local events, a detail screen for viewing event details, and a filter screen to select criteria for narrowing results. Other features include a collection widget, intent service for networking, SQLite database, content provider, data loaders, and Google Location Services.
